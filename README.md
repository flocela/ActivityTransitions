# ActivityTransitions
Demo for Activity Transitions to Demonstrate Material Design

branch: simpletransitions shows the whole activity window sliding and also shared element views exchanging places.
branch: circular_reveal shows a dot in one activity moving in an arc motion to its spot in the next activity and the circular reveal of text below the dot.

Websites used to make Activity Transition demos. I recommend them for learning Activity Transitions.
